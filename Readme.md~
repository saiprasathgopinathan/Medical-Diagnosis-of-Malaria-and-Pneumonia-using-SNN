# Medical Diagnosis of Malaria and Pneumonia using SNN

Self Normalizing Neural Networks are used for diagnosing malaria and pneumonia and compared with the Inception model's performance.
SNN performs same as Inception, with very low computing time at low learning rate for malaria and pneumonia.
SNN outperformed Inception at a higher learning rate for pneumonia. 

SNN is a model inspired from ResNet. SNN uses the skip connection like ResNet and adds the tensor outputs of both the connections together.
SNN employs both short and long skip connections, as a result of which convergence is better and faster.

## Pneumonia
The dataset is publicly available in https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia


### Time taken by different models for training pneumonia

SNN model is able to train faster than other models, because it's capable of training with images of smaller size, thus the number of convolutions operations to be performed is less, speeding the training process.
