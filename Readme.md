# Medical Diagnosis of Malaria and Pneumonia using SNN

Self Normalizing Neural Networks are used for diagnosing malaria and pneumonia and compared with the ResNet and Inception performance.
SNN performs almost as good as Inception and ResNet, with very low computing time at low learning rate for malaria and pneumonia.
SNN outperformed Inception and ResNet at a higher learning rate for pneumonia.
